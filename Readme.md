## 🧠 Overview

_In the distant future, few creatures remain._

You wake up as a broken robot—your memories fragmented, your purpose unclear. The only thing that drives you forward is the sight of a lone cat, darting through the ruins. Instinct takes over—you must chase it. But as the pursuit intensifies, the world around you begins to whisper forgotten truths.

> **Will you fix yourself... or uncover a truth too devastating to fix?**

BitFlip is a narrative-rich 2D platformer with minimal UI, immersive storytelling, and an emotionally resonant twist. It challenges players not just with puzzles and platforming, but with existential choices embedded in level design.
