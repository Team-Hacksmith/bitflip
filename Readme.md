### **A Futuristic Chase with a Haunting Truth**  

## **Overview**  
_In the distant future, few creatures remain._  
You wake up as a broken robot, your memories fragmented, your purpose unclear. The only thing that drives you forward is the sight of a lone cat, darting through the ruins. Instinct takes overâ€”you must chase it. But as the pursuit intensifies, the world around you begins to whisper forgotten truths.  

Will you fix yourself... or will you uncover a truth too devastating to fix?
